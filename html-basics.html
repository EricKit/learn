        <p>
            Create a file named helloworld.txt and open it in notepad or your
            favorite text editor.
        </p>
        <p>
            NOTE: The .txt extension is very important. Only programs that save
            pure text should open this file format, and they should save it
            correctly. The .txt file extension is for a file that contains only
            plain text with no styling or formatting (much like this site!).
        </p>
        <p>Put the below code into the text file and save it</p>
        <code>
            <xmp>
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
            <p>This is my first website!</p>
            </xmp>
        </code>
        <p>
            Rename your file to helloworld.html and open it. Your browser should
            launch and you should see a very simple website. We could have
            started with this file ending in .html, but you would have had to
            right click it and open it with a different program. This is because
            .html files open in the browser by default.
        </p>
        <p>
            You just did three things. You used
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML"
                >HTML</a
            >
            to create two
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element"
                >elements</a
            >
            using the
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element"
                >tags</a
            >
            &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt;. Click the three links to read about HTML,
            elements, and tags.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note: At any time you can view the source code for this website. In
            Safari go to Safari - Settings - Advanced - "show features for web
            developers". Then you can click the develop tab and select "show web
            inspector." In most Chromium browsers (Brave, Chrome, Edge, etc) you
            can go to view - developer - "developer tools". If that doesn't
            work, just google how to view page source for the browser you are
            in.

        <p>This website sure is ugly... we need to make it better.</p>

        <h2>Attributes</h2>

        <p>
            Elements are pretty basic. However, you can provide additional
            functionality to an element with attributes. Let's modify our
            example.
        </p>

        <code>
            <xmp>
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
            <p>This is my first website!</p>
            <img src="https://media.defense.gov/2006/Aug/10/2000546077/700/700/0/060810-F-JZ506-397.JPG" /></xmp>
        </code>

        <p>
            img on its own doesn't do much. It needs the attribute `src` to know
            where to find the image. You will also notice that the img tag self
            closes. It doesn't need a second tag to close it because there is no
            text needed between the opening and closing tag, unlike h1 and p.

            Here is a short reading on
            <a

            >
                attributes</a
            >, then you can read about
