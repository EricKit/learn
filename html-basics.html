<h1>HTML Basics</h1>
<p>Create a file named helloworld.txt and open it in notepad.</p>
<p>
    NOTE: The .txt extension is very important. Only programs that save pure
    text should open this file format, and they should save it correctly. The
    .txt file extension is for a file that contains only plain text with no
    styling or formatting (much like this site!).
</p>
<p>Put the below code into the text file and save it</p>
<code>
    <xmp>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first website!</p></xmp>
</code>
<p>
    Rename your file to helloworld.html and open it. Your browser should launch
    and you should see a very simple website. We could have started with this
    file ending in .html, but you would have had to right click it and open it
    with a different program. This is because .html files open in the browser by
    default.
</p>
<p>
    You just did three things. You used
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML</a> to
    create two
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element"
        >elements</a
    >
    using the
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element">tags</a>
    &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt;. Click the three links to read about HTML,
    elements, and tags.

<p>This website sure is ugly... we need to make it better.</p>
