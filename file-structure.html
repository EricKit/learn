<h1>File Structure</h1>
<p>
    Files on your computer are organized in folders. The "address" for one of
    these folders is called a path. Operating systems intentionally hide these
    paths from users to make the operating system more user-friendly. Most users
    don't need to understand the file structure. The operating system will
    create shortcuts to these folders and place them on the left side of your
    file explorer (Windows) or finder (Mac).
</p>
<p>
    The root path is the topmost folder on your computer. It's usually called
    "C:\" on Windows or "/" on Mac. There are multiple folders in there, such as
    "Program Files" or "Applications." Another folder is "Users," which contains
    folders for each user on the computer. Your Desktop's path on a Mac is
    /Users/username/Desktop or C:\Users\username\Desktop on Windows.
</p>
<p>
    You should always know where your files are on your computer! Even if you
    have "iCloud" on the left side of the computer, they still have a path on
    your computer. All the cloud means is that the files may be backed up to a
    server and downloaded when you request them. But the Operating system
    manages all of that, and it should be transparent to you.

<h2>Terminal</h2>
<p>
    Here is a very beginner lesson on the terminal to explore your file system.
    If you are on Windows you need WSL to do this, but you can also do it in
    Power Shell or the command prompt. The syntax will be slightly different
    though than what I'm describing.
</p>
<h3>Common Commands</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        cd [folder] - Open up the folder you type. If you give an absolute path
        such as /Users/username it will open that path. If you give a relative
        (not leading with a /), it will open the folder relative to your current
        location.
    </li>
    <li>
        . - present location. Typing "cd myFolder" and "cd ./myFolder" is the
        same thing.
    </li>
    <li>
        .. - previous folder. If you were in /Users/eric and wanted to go to
        /Users/trojan you could type "cd ../trojan"
    </li>
    <li>ls - displays all the files in a folder</li>
    <li>
        mv [from] [to] - Move a file or folder such as "mv ./file.txt
        ../differenFolder/"
    </li>
    <li>rm [file] - delete (Be careful! It will be gone forever)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Open up your terminal and type "cd /" then type "ls" and you will see all
    the files and folders in your root directory. Then type "cd Users" and type
    "ls" again to see all the users on your computer. Eventually... the terminal
    will replace you clicking around in finder. It's faster when you get good at
    it. Use tab to auto complete when you've typed enough. For example "cd /U
    [tab]" and if that is the only folder that starts with U, it will auto
    complete.
