    <p>
      Windows or Mac? It's really your preference. If you have a preference, use that. If you are 100% on the fence, use
      a Mac due to the terminal. But I'm biased.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will add a lot more to this page as this is a very very complicated subject. Please just see me to get to
      started. Please don't use Git or Github until I help you.... unless you are brave.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Visual Studio Code (VSCode) - The best text editor alive I believe. It's lightweight and very good. It is the
        most popular editor used.
      </li>
      <li>
        Zed - This is how we will use LLMs. VSCode can do it too, but other IDEs are better for coding with LLMs. After
        some research, we will use Zed. You do not need this yet, this is for much later. Use VSCode.
      </li>
      <li>
        Terminal - On a mac this is called terminal. On Windows you will use WSL. You may be able to get by without
        dealing with this, but not forever. Many developers work on Linux, Mac, or Unix simply for the linux
        environment.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For both of these you will just open your project <b>folder</b> in it. All your files will be on the left side.
    </p>
    <h2>VS Code</h2>
    <p>
      When you open VS Code, you can select File - Open. Navigate to the folder that contains all your files and open
      the folder. Do not open just one file! All the files in that folder will show on the left side and you can edit
      them as you wish.
