<h1>Developer Environment</h1>
<p>
    I will add a lot more to this page as this is a very very complicated
    subject. Please just see me to get to started.
</p>
<p>
    But if you can't see me and/or you want to get started...we will be using
    these two programs.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Visual Studio Code (VSCode) - The best text editor alive I believe. It's
        lightweight and very good. It is the most popular editor used.
    </li>
    <li>
        Zed - This is how we will use LLMs. VSCode can do it too, but other IDEs
        are better for coding with LLMs. After some research, we will use Zed.
        But you can follow your heart.
    </li>
    <li>
        Console - On a mac this is called console. On Windows you will use WSL.
        You will not use DOS or command prompt. You may be able to get by
        without dealing with this. Many developers work on Linux, Mac, or Unix
        simply for the linux environment.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For both of these you will just open your project <b>folder</b> in it. All
    your files will be on the left side.
