<h1>Developer Environment</h1>
<p>
    Windows or Mac? It's really your preference. If you have a preference, use
    that. If you are 100% on the fence, use a Mac due to the terminal. But I'm
    biased.
</p>
<p>
    I will add a lot more to this page as this is a very very complicated
    subject. Please just see me to get to started.
</p>
<p>
    But if you can't see me and/or you want to get started...we will be using
    these two programs.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Visual Studio Code (VSCode) - The best text editor alive I believe. It's
        lightweight and very good. It is the most popular editor used.
    </li>
    <li>
        Zed - This is how we will use LLMs. VSCode can do it too, but other IDEs
        are better for coding with LLMs. After some research, we will use Zed.
        But you can follow your heart.
    </li>
    <li>
        Terminal - On a mac this is called terminal. On Windows you will use
        WSL. You may be able to get by without dealing with this. Many
        developers work on Linux, Mac, or Unix simply for the linux environment.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For both of these you will just open your project <b>folder</b> in it. All
    your files will be on the left side.
</p>
<h2>VS Code</h2>
<p>
    When you open VS Code, you can select File - Open. Navigate to the folder
    that contains all your files and open the folder. Do not open just one file!
    All the files in that folder will show on the left side and you can edit
    them as you wish.
</p>
