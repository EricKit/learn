            <h1>Javascript Basics</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The goal in this short intro is to get you coding. Over the
                course of the next few months you will learn more.
            </p>
            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>
                Let's start with the most basic of basics. Variables are used to
                store values. In Javascript variables can be of multiple types.
                There are 8 basic

                    >primative types</a
                >.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Number - Used to store numeric values</li>
                <li>String - Used to store text values</li>
                <li>Boolean - Used to store true or false values</li>
                <li>
                    Object - Much more complex than the other types, I will
                    explain more later.
                </li>
                <li>
                    undefined - You will use this a lot! The variables has no
                    value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    null - It's null...it's weird. It provides unexpected
                    results in equality, try not to use it.
                </li>
                <li>BigInt - We won't use this</li>
                <li>
                    Symbol - You will use this, but you won't know you are using
                    it. Don't worry about it now.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In javascript you declare a varaible with <code>let</code> or
                <code>const</code>. Let is how you declare a variable that you
                plan to change. Const is how you declare a constant variable
                that does not change. You should default to const until you have
                to use let.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
            let result = 0;
            const firstNumber = 5;
            const secondNumber = 10;
            result = firstNumber + secondNumber;
            console.log(result); // Output: 15 to the console in your web inspector in the browser.
        </code></pre>
            <h2>Equality and Assignments</h2>
            <p>
                You will often test for equality in javascript or assign values
                to variables. The <code>=</code> operator is an assignment
                operator. It means take the value on the right side and put it
                into the variable on the left. It is not testing equality, it is
                assigning!
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>==</code> is a test for equality. But it provides
                unexpected results. It will do type conversions then compare for
                equality. For exmaple if you compare the string "0" to the
                number 0, it will return true. If you compare the string "0" to
                the boolean false, it will return true! There are many edge
                cases and you should not use this.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>===</code> is a test for equality. It will not do type
                conversions. It will compare the value and the type. If the
                types are different, it will return false. You can also do > or
                &lt; as you would expect. You will notice the //. This is just a
                comment and will not be viewed as code.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
    "0" = 0 // Error, you can't assign a value to "0".
    "0" == 0 // True
    "0" == false // returns True
    "0" == true // returns false
    "0" === 0 // False!
    const age = 25;
    age === 21 // False
    age >= 21 // True
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                There are other control structures we will learn about in
                person. I will just give a few examples below. Here is the
                structure of an if statement. You don't have to include the
                <code>else</code> or <code>else if</code>.
            </p>

            <pre><code>
    const age = 25;
    if (age >= 21) then {       // First case
        console.log("They can drink.")
    } else if (age <= 12) {     // You can add another condition if the first one is false
        console.log("They can have orange juice.")
    } else {                    // Covers all other cases
        console.log("Watch out for them in this age group")
    }
            </code></pre>
            <p>Here is a for loop</p>
            <pre><code>
    let age = 20;
    for (let i = 0; i &LT; 10; i++) { // Start at 0, go to 9 incrementing by 1.
        age = age + 1
        console.log('They are ' + age + ' years old');
    }
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The above code will print "They are 10 years old" "They are 11
                years old" ... "They are 19 years old". There is much much more
                to go over. But let's put this into action. You should have
                Visual Studio Code setup now. Use VSCode to write this code.
                Create javascript-basics.js and put it in the same folder. It
                should be empty now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's get values from the user. For this we will use an input.
            </p>
            <input type="number" id="first" />
            <input type="number" id="second" />
            <input id="add" type="button" value="add" />
            <output id="result">0</output>
            <p>
                To see how this works, open up the web inspector and look at
                javascript-basics.js and the HTML. It uses the element IDs to
                get the values, then puts the result into the right output. See
                if you can get it to work on your website. I know this is a lot.
                It's time to start your own project. We will need to sit down,
                set up your environment, then get you started.
            </p>
            <p>
                Congrats! You have made a website that uses HTML, CSS, and
                Javascript from scratch. Most new developers skip this step and
                miss out on the foundational knowledge of how it works. Now we
                will make it easier and use a framework. This get element by ID
                stuff is annoying. We won't be doing that anymore...more to
                follow.
