        <h1>CSS Basics</h1>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
            describe how the HTML should look. HTML is easy, you have elements,
            tags, and attributes. You can go to the W3Schools or MDN websites
            and look up exactly what they do. CSS..... not that easy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning CSS will be a journey, and one we won't learn on this
            lesson. You will learn it through practice. This is one area I think
            the LLMs will help with. Here are some basic CSS principals with
            links to read more about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, open this website in the web inspector. You should see a
            sources tab. In that tab you should find styles/styles.css. Open
            this file while you read this.
        </p>
        <p>CSS syntax is in the format</p>
        <code> what-it-applies-to { what-to-change: value; } </code>
        <p>
            The what-it-applies-to can be an element, id, class, or some
            combination of the items. These are called selectors. In HTML, most
            elements can have the attribute "class" or "id" to help you "select"
            that class in CSS.
        </p>
        <code>&lt;div class="some-class" id="some-id"&gt;</code>
        <p>
            Think of id as a unique identifier for an element, while class is a
            way to group elements with similar styles. In CSS, you can apply
            "styles" to elements on a website by using "selectors" to tell the
            browser where you want to apply these styles. In CSS, selectors can
            be element types such as an H1, classes which are specified with a
            "." or specific elements which are specified with a "#". Examples of
            selectors are "h1", ".some-class", or "#some-id".
        </p>
        <p>
            If you separate the selectors with commas, it will apply to all of
            them. For example "h1, p, .active, #id1" will apply to h1 and p
            elements, as well as elements with the class "active", and the one
            element with the id of "id1".These are called selectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also do embedded selectors to get more specicific.
            "nav.navbar ul li p.article" would apply only to "p" paragraph
            elements with the class "article" that full under a list item that
            fall under an unordered list that full under a "nav" element with
            the class "navbar". That's a VERY specific selector.
        </p>
        <p>
            The text inside of the curly braces {} is just a set of "properties"
            with values to style the elements that are matched to the selector.
            Look at this page and see why it looks the way it does! Colors are
            specified in multiple formats, you will see hexidecimal here which
            is in the format #FFF or #FFFFFF.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/What_is_CSS"
                    >Reading</a
                >
                - Read all the links under "CSS Styling Basics". This is a lot
                of reading. It will save you hours later.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Specificity"
                    >Specificity</a
                >
                - The same element may have multiple conflicting styles. You may
                specificy a default font size for the body element, then a more
                specific one for the H1 elements, then an even more specific one
                for the class "navbar". Which one applies? Specificity is your
                answer. In the web inspector you can select an element and see
                <b>all</b> of the styles that apply to it, and which ones are
                actually being applied.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/index.php"
                    >Properties</a
                >
                - Here is a list of all the properties!
            </li>
        </ul>

            Practice learning CSS and debugging. Open up this website and look
            at the CSS file. I have commented it to explain what you are seeing
            on this website.
