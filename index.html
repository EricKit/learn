        <h1>Why web development?</h1>
        <p>
            Most programming languages can quickly create a product for you to
            use. However, the challenge is getting that product to the user. Do
            you compile it for Windows, Mac with 32-bit, 64-bit, or ARM? Do you
            rewrite it for iOS in Swift, then rewrite it for Android in Kotlin?
            How do you create a visual element for the user to see for each of
            these? They are all different.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there is one incredibly complicated program that
            <s>will</s> <i>should</i> show you the same exact user experience
            across all platforms without changing the code you are writing. It's
            called the browser!
        </p>
        <p>
            For the new programmer without a team of engineers working for you,
            this is the only realistic way to get up and running quickly on
            multiple platforms. I've tried. Maintaining multiple code bases for
            multiple platforms, while learning the native language for each
            platform such as Swift (iOS) or Kotlin (Android) is just too much.

            Not to mention,
            <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology">
                javascript is the most popular programming language
            </a>
            in the world! And you can do much more than make websites once you
            learn javascript.
        </p>

        <h1>Philosophy to learning</h1>
        <p>
            Web development is a fast evolving world. You will hear about HTML,
            CSS, javascript, TypeScript, Angular, React, Svelte, SolidJS, and
            more. New programmers just dive right into a TypeScript React
            website in Visual Studio Code and make something simple fast. Then
            they hit a wall because they don't understand the basics. That's the
            goal in these first few lessons, to teach you the basics.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will need to be familiar with, but not fully learn or memorize,
            what HTML is. Then you will learn how to make your website look
            nicer with CSS. Then we'll add some functionality with javascript.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note: Many purists will claim you can do almost anything with only
            HTML and CSS. They are kind-of right, many people go to javascript
            to solve problems that can be solved with just HTML and CSS. But
            javascript is essential to adding complex functionality.
